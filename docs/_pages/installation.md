If you have not done that, please follow these steps:

 - To install R on Linux follow this [link](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html) 
 - Download and install RStudio [hier](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
 - If you still havenâ€™t installed the Shiny package, start the RStudio, connect to the internet, and run:

```

### Start the Application
Open the RStudio and write this:
```markdown
shiny::runGist("https://gist.github.com/sforteva/138af2ea533c2d1c3d1631b5d2d41e86")
